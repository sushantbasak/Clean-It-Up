# Clean-It-Up
A website for improving Cleanliness.

## Description
Clean It Up is a web-based application that will allow users to report/request any sanitation-related task. This task will be completed by one of the Sanitation workers. Finally, after completion of the job and verification by the admin job will be marked closed.

## Motivation
With the rising importance of Cleanliness and Sanitation after the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission in India, existing methodologies cannot deal with this problem efficiently.
Tackling this problem is of utmost importance because with such a large population, if cleanliness and sanitation are not appropriately done, an outbreak of many diseases such as dengue, plague, etc. can take a severe hit on our population. Clean It Up will solve inefficient and lousy cleaning/garbage collection performed by authorities with no one to monitor them and manage them properly.
